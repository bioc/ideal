Description: This package provides functions for an Interactive
    Differential Expression AnaLysis of RNA-sequencing datasets, to
    extract quickly and effectively information downstream the step
    of differential expression. A Shiny application encapsulates
    the whole package. Support for reproducibility of the whole analysis is 
    provided by means of a template report which gets automatically compiled 
    and can be stored/shared.
